# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 10, 2021

**Today's Progress**: This is my 2nd attempt at 100daysofcode, and I'm working through the book Python Basics from Real Python.  
I completed chapter 6 that focused on functions, for loops, while loops, and scope. I completed the exercises that led to the creation of the following files:

- ch6_functions.py
- ch6_convert_temperature.py
- investment.py  

I also completed the online quiz for chapter 6 on RealPython.com

**Thoughts:** I'm not completely new at Python programming nor am I an expert so I jumped ahead in the book to chapter 6 where, I believe, the process has the best chance of holding my interest.

### Day 1: September 11, 2021  

**Today's Progress**: I completed the debugging section of Python Basics chapter 7 and scored a 100% on the online quiz. I created the following files:  

- ch7_debugging_example.py  
- ch7_debug_add_underscores.py  

**Thoughts**: I was actually looking forward to working on this today. I believe my desire to continue will grow as the topic becomes more advanced.
