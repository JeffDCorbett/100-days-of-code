# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: My first day of learning JavaScript involved setting the foundation for a basic Battleship game.  

- battleship.html
- battleship.js

**Thoughts:** I think it is going to be very easy to get brackets, { }, out of place. This should be a very  
interesting process. 

**Link to work:** [Battleship](https://github.com/JeffDCorbett/battleship)

### Known Bugs:
**Hits** - Once a hit location is found entering the same number two more times results in sunken ship. Need to record  
and compare against guessed numbers.
