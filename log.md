# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: My first day of learning JavaScript involved setting the foundation for a basic Battleship game.  

- battleship.html
- battleship.js

**Thoughts:** I think it is going to be very easy to get brackets, { }, out of place. This should be a very  
interesting process. 

**Link to work:** [Battleship](https://github.com/JeffDCorbett/battleship)

### Known Bugs:
**Hits** - Once a hit location is found entering the same number two more times results in sunken ship. Need to record  
and compare against guessed numbers.

### Day 1: April 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: The focus was on functions; the basics of how to structure them, call them, pass arguments, and return values.  
I'm learning JavaScript using the book "Head First JavaScript Programming" 

- calculate_area.js

**Thoughts:** Most of today's work seemed redundant as I am not completely new to programming. I've written a full-stack app  
in Python/Flask that is currently in use, so the concepts are not new, but I feel I need a deep dive into JS.

### Day 2: April 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: The focus was on arrays and iterating over them with while and for loops. I created two new files for examples.  

- arrayWhileLoop.js
- arrayForLoop.js  

The for loop contains improvements over the while loop example such as post-increment operator, empty array creation, and  
array push functionality.

**Thoughts:** Today's work was much more interesting than yesterday. As I mentioned before, I'm using "Head First JavaScript Programming"  
as my guide, and some conventions in the book are outdated.

- VAR vs Let to define variables
- == vs === to prevent type coercion  

I'm using (and learning) the IDE Webstorm which is very good at pointing out the differences between conventions. A quick look at  
tomorrow's lesson involves refactoring the arrays. It's hard to stop for the night, but it's family time.

### Day 3: April 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continued with work on arrays, functions, and iteration. Added parallel arrays to find the best cost for the highest score.

- bubbles.html

**Thoughts**: I struggled with the logic a bit on connecting the dots between the parallel arrays in the getMostCostEffectiveSolution function.  
For the most part my head just wasn't in it today, but I did manage to get through with a little Google assistance.  
I expanded on the example a bit by displaying the cost in the final result.  

Currently, everything I'm coding is going into my [Battleship](https://github.com/JeffDCorbett/battleship) project, which I do not like, but I'm assuming these extra examples will play a role in the game at some point.

### Day 4: April 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Performed some very basic tinkering with objects. It was definitely more reading than coding, but I'm sure there is more to come.  

- cars.js

**Thoughts**: The work this evening was not very intriguing and I feel like I missed the point of it. I will go over it again tomorrow before diving in to more.  

### Day 5: April 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Expanded on yesterday's object examples to include automation using Math.random().  

-auto_o_matic.html

**Thoughts**: I need to explore options for applying these techniques to real world situations. I know I will have issues making these concepts stick until I can apply them in a meaningful way.  

### Day 6: April 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I covered a lot more in regard to objects by adding methods and learning the use of "this" to access properties.  

- carWithDrive.html
- eightBall.js
- eightBall.html
- crackTheCode.js
- crackTheCode.html

**Thoughts**: The final example, crackTheCode, felt more like object oriented programming and it feels great to be getting started down this path. I'm happier with today's progress and looking forward to moving forward.  

### Day 7: April 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I took some time to review and reflect. The Magic 8 Ball example, eightBall.js, didn't make sense to me. It's not a situation where you would want to iterate through responses, so I updated it to use Math.random.  

Moved on to learn about DOM, getElementById, and window.onload with init function.  

- planets.html

**Thoughts**: Feels like I'm starting to move out of the simple beginner stuff and really starting to find ways to manipulate pages with JS. Feels like it is going to start getting fun!  

### Day 8: April 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Got more practice manipulating static pages by getting an element id in the DOM

- myPlaylist.html

**Thoughts**: I'm interested in seeing where this is going. I'm looking forward to progressing further in the book and, hopefully, getting into a project.  

### Day 9: April 24, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today was some additional manipulation of the DOM via JS code. Updated planet.html to change an attribute to add CSS styling.  

- planets.html

**Thoughts**: I'm not sure if I'm helping or sabotaging my learning... Some of the examples in the book "Head First JS Programming" don't make sense to me. For example, the planet.html page changes the text of a paragraph tag using a function and window.onload. The change happens so fast that you never see the original text.  

I looked up setTimeout and changed the code to run the function after 10 seconds. You get to see the original text and then 10 seconds later BOOM the magic happens.  

In the Magic 8 Ball example, responses were iterated through which didn't make sense to me especially since the "car" examples used Math.random. I updated the Magic 8 Ball example to use random responses instead of iteration.  

###Day 10: April 25  

**Today's Progress**: I deviated from the JS path to do a little Python. Created a function that finds unique words in two separate sentences.  

ex: sentence a = "the pancakes taste sweet"  
ex: sentence b = "the pancakes taste salty"  
result: ['sweet', 'salty']  

I then rewrote the function to reduce the number of lines.  

- unique_words.py
- unique_words_improved.py  

**Thoughts**: I felt like I needed a break from the JS examples I've been doing and spend a little time on Python. I really enjoy Python and look forward to moving forward with it.  

### Day 11: April 26  

**Today's Progress**: Learned about types and the use of typeOf. Interesting information about NaN, Truthy, and Falsy. Two files added today.  

- typeOf.js
- lieDetectorTest.js  

**Thoughts**: I'm progressing through Head First JS Programming, about 46% complete, and the concepts are beginning to get a little more involved. I'm interested to see how this plays out. I'm hoping for a tangible project before the end.  

### Day 12: April 27  

**Today's Progress**: I read more Head First JS Programming and reviewed everything I've covered so far in the book's exercises. Then I worked on Python code challenges on Pythonista Cafe and HackerRank.  

- I scored 20 points in the Print Function challenge on HackerRank https://www.hackerrank.com//challenges/python-print/submissions/code/210779333  

**Thoughts**: I completed the introductory Python code challenges on HackerRank. The challenges really make you think. Love it!
