# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 10, 2021

**Today's Progress**: This is my 2nd attempt at 100daysofcode, and I'm working through the book Python Basics from Real Python.  
I completed chapter 6 that focused on functions, for loops, while loops, and scope. I completed the exercises that led to the creation of the following files:

- ch6_functions.py
- ch6_convert_temperature.py
- investment.py  

I also completed the online quiz for chapter 6 on RealPython.com

**Thoughts:** I'm not completely new at Python programming nor am I an expert so I jumped ahead in the book to chapter 6 where, I believe, the process has the best chance of holding my interest.
